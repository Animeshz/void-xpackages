# Extended Void Packages Collection

This is an unofficial repository, that contains xbps-src templates (as in void-linux/void-packages) of applications either not being accepted in the official repository due to various reasons (including quality standards which require packages to be tagged/released as versions) or needs more work done to be in the official repository. It is primarily intended for my private use.


<!-- Dekho bhai kaam void-packages me karenge, delta leynge HEAD se and then pipe krke apply krdenge, or agar clone krna hua to simply merge wala krenge -->
